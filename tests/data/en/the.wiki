{{rel-top|pronunciation notes}}
The word ''the'' is commonly pronounced {{IPAchar|/ðiː/}} whenever it is pronounced as a distinct word, e.g.:
* When it is used for emphasis ({{l|en||This is where ''the'' hospital for open-heart surgery is}}).
* When the speaker pauses between ''the'' and the next word ({{m|en||the … sovereignty}}).
* In many but not all dialects, when the next word begins with a vowel sound ({{m|en||the onion}}) (compare with {{l|en|a}} vs. {{l|en|an}}).
The word is generally pronounced indistinctly as {{IPAchar|/ðə/}} or merely {{IPAchar|/ð/}} in other situations, such as when attached to a word beginning with a consonant sound.

{{rel-top|"the" vs. "ye"}}
The [[eye dialect|typographical pronunciation]] {{IPAchar|/jiː/}} (''"'''[[ye#Etymology_2|Ye]]''' Old..."'') is a deliberately archaic [[retronym]] from {{m|en|ye}}, which is a variant spelling of [[þe]], from Old English [[þe#Old English|þē]] pronounced '''''thē''''', {{IPAchar|/θeː/|/ðeː/}}  (using [[y]] in place of the [[thorn]] ([[þ]]). It is not actually a separate pronunciation in Middle English. The actual [[morpheme]] {{IPAchar|/jiː/}} in Middle English represents [[ȝe-]], a variant spelling of the prefix [[y-]] attached to [[verb]]s and used to denote a verbal [[past participle]].
{{rel-bottom}}

===Etymology 1===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*só}}From {{inh|en|enm|þe}}, from {{inh|en|ang|þē||the, that|pos=[[demonstrative pronoun]]|g=m}}, a late variant of {{m|ang|sē}}, the ''s-'' (which occurred in the masculine and feminine nominative singular only) having been replaced by the ''þ-'' from the oblique stem.
{{rel-top|replaced words, cognates}}
Originally neutral nominative, in Middle English it superseded all previous Old English nominative forms ({{m|ang|sē|g=m}}, {{m|ang|sēo|g=f}}, {{m|ang|þæt|g=n}}, {{m|ang|þā|g=p}}); {{m|ang|sē}} is from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*siz}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*sa}}, ultimately from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*só}}.

Cognate with {{cog|stq|die|t=the}}, {{cog|fy|de|t=the}}, {{cog|nl|de|t=the}}, {{cog|nds-de|de|t=the}}, {{cog|de|der|t=the}}, {{cog|da|de|t=the}}, {{cog|sv|de|t=the}}, {{cog|is|sá|t=that}} within Germanic and with {{cog|sa|sá|t=the, that}}, {{cog|grc|ὁ|t=the}}, {{cog|txb|se|t=this}} among other Indo-European languages.<ref>{{R:ine:LIPP|volume=2|pages=732-733}}</ref>

===Etymology 2===
From {{inh|en|enm|the}}, {{m|enm|thy}}, {{m|enm|thi}}, from {{inh|en|ang|þe|þē̆}}, probably a neuter instrumental form ("by that, thereby")—alongside the more common {{m|ang|þȳ}} and {{m|ang|þon}}—of the demonstrative pronoun {{m|ang|sē}} ("that"). Compare {{cog|nl|des te|des ''te''}} ("the, the more"), {{cog|de|desto|des''to''}} ("the, all the more"), {{cog|no|fordi|for''di''}} and {{cog|no|av di|av di}} ("because"), {{cog|is|því||the; because}}, {{cog|fo|tí}}, {{cog|sv|ty}}.

====Adverb====
{{en-adv|-}}

# {{non-gloss definition|1=With a [[comparative]] or with {{m|en|more}} and a verb phrase, establishes a correlation with one or more other such comparatives.}}
#: '''''The''' hotter(,) '''the''' better.'' {{gloss|comma usually omitted in such very short expressions}}
#: '''''The''' more I think about it, '''the''' weaker it looks.''
#: '''''The''' more money donated, '''the''' more books purchased, and '''the''' more happy children.''
#: ''It looks weaker and weaker, '''the''' more I think about it.''
# {{non-gloss definition|1=With a [[comparative]], and often with {{m|en|for it}}, indicates a result more like said comparative. This can be negated with {{m|en|none}}.}}
#: {{ux|en|It was a difficult time, but I’m '''the''' wiser for it.}}
#: {{ux|en|It was a difficult time, and I’m {none - not any} '''the''' wiser for it.}}
#: {{ux|en|I'm much '''the''' wiser for having had a difficult time like that.}}
# {{lb|en|with a superlative adjective}} Beyond all others.
#: {{ux|en|We went '''the''' furthest under her leadership.}}
#: {{ux|en|They trusted him '''the''' most.}}

=====Usage notes=====
This is called the "comparative correlative", but it is also known as the "correlative construction", the "conditional comparative", or the "the...the construction".
