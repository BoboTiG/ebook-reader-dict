==Central Franconian==

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|gmw-cfr|un}} {{qualifier|widely in free variation}}
* {{l|gmw-cfr|en}} {{qualifier|some western dialects}}

===Etymology===
The native form in most dialects was {{inh|gmw-cfr|goh|indi}}, whence the variant {{m|gmw-cfr||en}}. In parts of the Eifel, this {{m|goh||indi}} regularly becomes {{m|gmw-cfr||on}} (compare {{cog|lb|an}}). In southern and eastern dialects, on the other hand, {{m|gmw-cfr||on}} may have been inherited from the Old High German variant {{m|goh|unde}} ({{m|goh|unti}}). From these two groups of dialects, the form will have spread, without doubt under influence of {{der|gmw-cfr|de|und}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|gmw-cfr|/on/}}

{{head|gmw-cfr|conjunction}}

==French==

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|fr|l'on}} {{qualifier|formal}}

===Etymology===
From {{inh|fr|fro|hom}}, {{m|fro|om}} (nominative form), from {{inh|fr|la|homō||human being}} (compare {{m|fr|homme}} from the Old French oblique form {{m|fro|home}}, from the Latin accusative form {{m|la|hominem}}). Its pronominal use is of {{cog|gem}} origin. Compare {{cog|ang|man||one, they, people}}, reduced form of {{cog|ang|mann||man, person}}; {{cog|ca|hom}}; {{cog|de|man||one, they, people}}; {{cog|nl|men||one, they, people}}.

===Pronunciation===

===Pronoun===
{{fr-pron}}

# {{lb|fr|indefinite}} [[one]], [[people]], [[you]], [[someone]] {{gloss|an unspecified individual}}

#: {{ux|fr|'''On''' s’est amusés.|'''We''' had fun.|inline=1}}

====Usage notes====
