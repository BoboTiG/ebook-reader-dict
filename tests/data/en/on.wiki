===Alternative forms===
* {{l|gmw-cfr|un}} {{qualifier|widely in free variation}}
* {{l|gmw-cfr|en}} {{qualifier|some western dialects}}

===Etymology===
The native form in most dialects was {{inh|gmw-cfr|goh|indi}}, whence the variant {{m|gmw-cfr||en}}. In parts of the Eifel, this {{m|goh||indi}} regularly becomes {{m|gmw-cfr||on}} (compare {{cog|lb|an}}). In southern and eastern dialects, on the other hand, {{m|gmw-cfr||on}} may have been inherited from the Old High German variant {{m|goh|unde}} ({{m|goh|unti}}). From these two groups of dialects, the form will have spread, without doubt under influence of {{der|gmw-cfr|de|und}}.
